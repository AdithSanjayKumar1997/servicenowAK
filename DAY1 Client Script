=> OnLoad

Major use cases of OnLoad Client Script

1) Showing P1 message alert if the priority of current incident is p1.
2) Setting logged user in the caller field on incident form.
3) Showing message at the top of the form if the caller is VIP user


#1) Scenario

When P1 Incident is opened then there should be an alert which

#2) Scenario

when new incident form is opened then calleer should be populated automatically with current logged in user

Function onLoad() {

if(g_form.isNewRecord()){
var uSysID = g_user.userID;
var uValue = g_user.getFullName();
g_form.setValue('caller_id',uSYSID,uValue);
}
}



=> onSubmit

when a form is submitted. It is usually used to validate things on the form before the submission of the form

Major use cases of onSubmit 

1) Showing alert before creation of P1 Incident
2) Stop user for creating the incident if Assignment group is not correct as per selected category
3) Validate for mandatory fields on different forms


function onSubmit() {
var pri = g_form.getValue('priority');
if(pri == '1')
{
var uInput = confirm("Are you sure to create P1 incident?");
if(uInput == true){
return true;
}
else{
return false;
}
}



#2 scenario

when network assignment group is selected and category is hardware then user should not be able to create the incident



=> onChange

{
saveAndClose = true;
}
else {
saveAndClose = false;
}
